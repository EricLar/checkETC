	<tr>
		<td width="150">Sync Flag</td>
		<td>Not used in LI-7200. Will always read OK.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>PLL</td>
		<td>Phase Lock Loop offset, indicates the status of the optical filter wheel for the IRGA. Common causes of a service indication are not having a sensor head connected to the LI-7550, or the 19-pin IRGA cable is attached but the connectors have not been tightened properly.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Detector Temperature</td>
		<td>If not OK, indicates the detector cooler is not maintaining the proper temperature: this will happen at temperatures above 50 &deg;C. Note that this does not always indicate a serious problem; the cooler may simply have not yet reached the target temperature during instrument startup, 
or it may be out of range due to external environmental conditions. Readings may still be OK. The sensor head may not be attached to the LI-7550, or the IRGA cable may not be tight. Check cables and wiring.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Chopper Temperature</td>
		<td>If not OK, indicates the chopper temperature controller is out of range, hot or cold. As with the Detector Temperature indicator above, this may or may not indicate a serious problem. The chopper should be able to temperature control when ambient is between +50 and -25 &deg;C. Check that the sensor head cables to the LI-7550 are tight, and make sure the chopper temperature is not set to Winter when measuring in high ambient temperatures.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Head Pressure</td>
		<td>If not OK, the pressure reading at the LI-7200 sensor head is outside of its normal range. A service indication can also be caused by a loose or missing cable between the LI-7550 and the LI-7200 sensor head.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Aux Inputs</td>
		<td>If not OK, indicates that the two reference voltages on the LI-7550 analog circuit board cannot be checked properly. The LI-7550 needs service.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Inlet T</td>
		<td>If not OK, the temperature reading at the LI-7200 sensor head inlet is outside of its normal range. This can be caused by a loose or missing cable between the LI-7550 and the LI-7200 sensor head, or the inlet thermocouple has been broken.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Outlet T</td>
		<td>If not OK, the temperature reading at the LI-7200 sensor head outlet is outside of its normal range. This can be caused by a loose or missing cable between the LI-7550 and the LI-7200 sensor head, or the outlet thermocouple has been broken.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Head</td>
		<td>Displays the model of the sensor head currently connected to the LI-7550 Analyzer Interface Unit (LI-7500A or LI-7200).</td>
